      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report prepared by Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the application of Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 introducing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (2007/2094(INI)) (A6-0278/2007).</p>

    <intervention id="4-008" speaker_id="4504" name="Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, to begin with I must thank my many colleagues who contributed to this document. Seven years ago I was co-rapporteur for the directive, and we are now discussing the report on its application. Parliament’s position has been unanimous throughout, apart from one or two dissenters who, as you will see presently, tabled amendments. We have debated at length and sometimes fiercely, on the sharing of the burden of proof, for example, but happily we never lost sight of the common objective and I hope too that you will see this report as a common undertaking.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In 2000 we voted by a generous majority in favour of the directive, which can rightly be described as revolutionary. Discrimination was banned Europe-wide – in employment, in social security and housing, and equal treatment was made compulsory. I was and still am inordinately proud of that. Commission, Council and European Parliament did a good job there. But that does not mean, of course, that things have changed very much on the ground. A lot of discrimination still goes on.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In recent years instances of discrimination and racism have actually increased, both in number and in seriousness. In most countries, unemployment is significantly higher amongst migrants than amongst the rest of the working-age population. There is more racially motivated violence. Legislation is very important in countering discrimination, because it sets the standard. It tells people what the European Union stands for, how we should behave towards one another and what cannot be tolerated. Legislation also gives people a means of redress against discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European Commission is now busy checking whether Member States have properly transposed the European rules into their national laws. I talked about it just this week with Commissioner Špidla, and it is clear that the Commission's intentions are good here – it is keen to ensure, with Member States, that the legislation is implemented. And my compliments to the Commission on that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">But I cannot help but think that it needs a bit more zip, a bit more oomph. These laws were supposed to be implemented in 2004. There was much talk of sensitivities and difficult details, but when the present Commission took office you announced that measures to combat discrimination would be at the heart of your policy and you are already over halfway through your term. I have the greatest admiration for what you have done so far, but I hope you are going to be twisting Member States’ arms a little harder. That is vital.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Fewer than half of all Member States have implemented the directive fully. In many of them the definition of direct and indirect discrimination, intimidation and the burden of proof has not been correctly transposed. There are some Member States which certainly prohibit discrimination in employment but which saw it as a step too far to ban it in the provision of goods and services. But those are precisely the areas where there are many problems.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Take education, for example. According to the new EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, children from Roma families are inappropriately being placed in schools for mentally handicapped children. Or take housing; apartments are routinely advertised with the comment that the complex is ‘foreigner-free’. That is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The banning of discrimination, in other areas as well as employment, must be made effective immediately. A law is only effective, Mr President, if people know their rights, but according to Eurobarometer only 35% of people questioned think that there are anti-discrimination laws in their country. Fewer still say they would know what to do if they became victims of discrimination themselves. How is the Commission going to guarantee that the law becomes a reality in people’s lives? Informing people is a stated obligation in the directive, but how does the Commission propose to ensure that that obligation is enforced?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, even when people do know that a law exists, their path may still be beset by obstacles, because sometimes there are problematic rules and requirements. In some countries the period for filing a complaint is very short, as short as 30 days, for example. The rest of the procedure, by contrast, can be ridiculously long and complicated. Infringement of anti-discrimination laws must be met with effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions. That was very nicely said in the directive; we were all agreed on it. But very few countries have adequate sanctions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Time for a positive note, maybe. The good thing is that virtually all countries now have equality bodies. That is an important achievement, and in many countries those bodies concern themselves with racially motivated discrimination and with discrimination on other grounds too. I welcome that. But sadly not all bodies have the funds they need to carry out their remit, and so I ask the Commission to consider that point too in its evaluation of how anti-discrimination laws are being implemented. Can the Commission comment?</p>
      <p sl="nl">To conclude, Mr President: I am proud of the legislation. Progress has been made on transposition, but not yet enough. Many countries have not yet transposed it in full. But even where they have done so to the letter, we still need to be sure that people are properly informed of their rights, because if they are unaware of those rights they cannot invoke them, and that is so very important when it comes to fighting discrimination.</p>

    <intervention id="4-009" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mrs Buitenweg, Members of the House, the Commission welcomes this report on the application of Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission notes the various concerns that Parliament has expressed and would draw your attention to a number of points. With regard to monitoring the Member States’ implementation of the Directive, at the end of June the Commission initiated infringement proceedings against 14 Member States for failing to transpose the Directive properly into national law. I would add that a number of Member States have already amended their legislation in response to the Commission’s concerns, or have indicated that they are prepared to do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to detailed information on the Member States’ transposition of the Directive, as we noted in our 2005 Communication on a framework strategy for non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all, we publish the comprehensive report of the Legal Experts Group every year, and the individual national reports are available online.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Buitenweg rightly points out that the bodies charged with promoting equality play a key role in combating discrimination. That is why we fund the Equinet network, facilitating exchanges of experience and good practice among Member States’ equality bodies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As the report indicates, data collection is a sensitive business. Without it, however, it is impossible to assess the extent of discrimination or to know whether measures that have been taken are effective. Given that much of the information gathered may fall into the category of sensitive personal data, concerning people’s racial or ethnic origins, or indeed their religious beliefs or sex lives, it must be processed in accordance with the relevant provisions of Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That Directive imposes a general ban on the processing of sensitive personal data. However, it provides for a number of exceptions to the rule, notably if the individuals concerned have given their explicit consent or if – and I quote – processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out obligations and specific rights in the field of employment law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Member States are also empowered to lay down exemptions – subject to the provision of suitable safeguards – for reasons of substantial public interest. It is thus up to the Member States to decide whether or not they should collect data about ethnic origin, in order to produce statistics with a view to combating discrimination, subject to implementation of the safeguards that the data protection directive requires.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Eurobarometer study on discrimination in the European Union demonstrated that large numbers of European citizens were generally prepared to supply personal information anonymously in the context of a census, in order to combat discrimination. Three out of four were prepared to give personal information about their ethnic origin, religion or beliefs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Such information is particularly important in the context of positive action to alleviate discrimination and deeply rooted forms of disadvantage. Last February the Commission published a European guide to equality data, with the aim of helping the Member States to improve their data collection practice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The same Eurobarometer study of January 2007 revealed that people felt insufficiently informed about their rights as victims of discrimination. While the level of knowledge varied considerably – between Finland, for example, where 65% of those questioned said they were aware of their rights, and Austria, where the corresponding figure was just 17% – the fact that the average was only 32% clearly shows that, just as you have stated, awareness-raising activities are as necessary as ever.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am convinced that our current activities, backed up by the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All in 2007, which involved some 430 activities at Member State level, and the European campaign ‘For diversity. Against discrimination’ will help to counter this lack of awareness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would make particular mention here of the training programmes that we finance for NGOs, trade unions, lawyers and companies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is determined to use every available tool to improve the situation of the Roma in the European Union. Specifically this will mean ensuring that Directive 2000/43/EC is applied, utilising the Community Structural Funds, particularly the European Social Fund, and raising awareness among both the Roma themselves and the general public about their rights and obligations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A high-level consultative group on the social and vocational integration of ethnic minorities, including the Roma, is to submit its report with a series of recommendations at the beginning of December. The group aims to identify barriers to integration and to promote good practices as applied by public authorities and companies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context we welcome the European Parliament’s interest in the question of multiple discrimination, and I will certainly be keen to read, at the end of this year, the findings of a new study being conducted for the Commission. Clearly, non-discrimination alone is not enough to provide equal opportunities for certain groups who are more socially disadvantaged than others: the Commission has therefore asked for an in-depth analysis of good practice as applied in the Member States, particularly in relation to employment policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission also considers it very important that the Member States should apply their own laws properly, although legislation in itself is clearly insufficient. We aim to reinforce it through research, awareness raising, training and exchanges of good practice, so as to prevent discrimination where possible and, where that is not possible, to make adequate amends to its victims.</p>

    <intervention id="4-010" speaker_id="28183" name="Patrick Gaubert" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, colleagues, I should like to thank Mrs Buitenweg for the work she has done, which is of a high calibre. The report makes a number of fair and balanced points, and the major problems with the Directive’s application are covered thoroughly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that very few of our fellow citizens are clearly aware of their rights in the event of finding themselves the victims of discrimination. So it would seem essential to ensure that the relevant information is more effectively disseminated, particularly as this is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. Specifically, I support the idea of granting sufficient resources to the bodies tasked with promoting equality. Theirs is a key role here and, as the report rightly states, it is imperative that they should remain independent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The most worrying point made, however, concerns the failure of certain Member States to transpose the Directive, or to transpose it fully. We absolutely must take steps to ensure that all the Member States enact the laws necessary so that each individual, irrespective of his or her country of residence, can enjoy the essential level of protection.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the most sensitive issue addressed, namely data collection, the report is careful to stipulate that it must be carried out in a manner respectful of personal privacy, and solely for the purpose of detecting forms of discrimination from which minorities may suffer. It must never veer into the dangerous territory of ethnic profiling, but it must ultimately deliver the information required for gauging the extent of the discrimination and producing suitable solutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When it comes to a principle of such fundamental importance as equality of treatment, Europe cannot be content simply to pay lip service, Europe cannot be content to enact a bare minimum of legislation, and Europe cannot be content to be a mere observer. We do need to be watchful, but it is also up to us to act, to lead the way and to ensure that Europe sets an example: the more we can do that, the less we leave ourselves open to reproach.</p>

    <intervention id="4-011" speaker_id="4313" name="Martine Roure" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, first let me thank Mrs Buitenweg for the excellent work she has done. Her report has our full backing. Sadly, recent statistics show that discrimination remains a significant and ongoing problem in many Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first report by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, in August 2007, recorded an increase in racist crime in at least eight countries in the Union. This is particularly worrying given that the EU possesses highly developed legislation against discrimination. I agree, however, that the legislation has been poorly transposed and only partially implemented by the Member States. The people of Europe are not well informed and, in particular, they do not realise that they can use the legislation to assert their rights if they find themselves the victims of discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As rapporteur on the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and on the framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia, I believe the Member States need to work harder to ensure that the European legislation is properly applied. The texts we have produced also need to be more widely publicised, so that the people of Europe can identify with them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Reversing the burden of proof is the major advance that this Directive on equal treatment has produced. We must therefore insist that practical measures are put in place to secure this advance in all the EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I believe that we need to strengthen the European legal framework for combating discrimination by adopting an across-the-board directive covering all the forms of discrimination cited in Article 13 of the Treaty, and I should like to ask the Commission what progress has been made on studying the feasibility of such a directive.</p>

    <intervention id="4-012" speaker_id="28266" name="Sophia in 't Veld Veld" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, here in the European Parliament we make laws, but laws alone cannot eliminate racism and xenophobia. The utterances of politicians and other opinion leaders help to foster a climate of hatred and intolerance in which discrimination becomes normal, so that the law remains a dead letter.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like really to see the European Commission attacking discrimination in Europe as consistently as it attacks breaches of market rules, for example. We should protect human capital in Europe just as vigorously as financial capital. If we can take on Bill Gates, surely we can take on companies and authorities which discriminate. We know that 14 governments still have not complied with the Racial Equality Directive in one or two respects, but the Commission does not seem in too much of a hurry to enforce the rules and is giving Member States far too much time to come into line. This law should have been implemented years ago; we would not have let Bill Gates get away with it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">And in combating terrorism and crime we must not allow shifting goalposts. Some measures apply only to certain groups and appear to legitimise discrimination. Take, for example, stop-and-search practices, profiling methods, etc., etc. Integration measures can sometimes be discriminatory too and I am pleased to see, for example, that the last government in my own country sought to introduce measures on integration which were subsequently thrown out by the courts, because they were indeed discriminatory.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Of the various amendments, one in particular, Amendment 4, caught my attention. This says that protection of minorities and compliance with anti-discrimination legislation is a matter for the individual Member States. But if there is one thing that is not national, it is our common European values, and so it is very much a European responsibility to ensure equal treatment for every European citizen, because that is the aim of European integration and the market is merely a means to that end.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Lastly, religious freedom is a great and a fundamental right, but it must not be abused to justify discrimination on the basis of ethnicity. For example, a Catholic school must not use religious freedom as a pretext for excluding children of a certain ethnic background, when what it really wants is to keep the school white. And on the other hand, it is not automatically racist to criticise Islam.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Lastly, Mr President, laws are important and it is extremely good that we have this law, but we are all keen to maintain a climate in which discrimination no longer occurs.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank our colleague for her work. As the European Parliament’s rapporteur on the rights of minors, I should like to focus on an important part of this report, that is the part on Roma children. I should like to remind everyone here that it is children who suffer the worst problems of discrimination and social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="it">In Europe there are many, too many street children, often from Roma backgrounds, who have no future because they have not had a proper school education and in many cases are completely illiterate. These children do not receive proper medical care or the necessary vaccinations. They are consequently children who do not have a future, because they have been denied their childhood and because they are often forced to beg, to collect handouts, almost always during school hours, or end up in illegal work.</p>
      <p sl="it">As the report also says, the Member States have to commit themselves to introducing positive policies against discrimination. In this particular case, policies that guarantee children’s entitlement to an education and that require the families of these Roma children to make sure that they attend compulsory education. Suitable campaigns also need to be run to encourage citizens to work with schools to prevent instances of discrimination, exploitation and social exclusion among children.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would also conclude by saying that it is unacceptable that too many Member States, unfortunately including my own country, Italy, have yet properly to transpose the provisions of the Directive into national law.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Buitenweg for this report, which draws attention to one of the more serious issues in Europe’s problem of racial and ethnic discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, in my opinion the Commission should be more active in order to promote transposition of the Racial Equality Directive. Each day brings us a lot of cases where correct transposition is necessary to protect victims. I would also like to mention that some practices related to linguistic policy may be considered as indirect discrimination under the Directive. For example, in my country, Latvia, as well as in neighbouring Estonia, states which have a high proportion of ethnic minorities, there are disproportionate language criteria for employment, as well as requirements to use only one language in communication with authorities. I believe that if such practices lead to under-representation of racial and ethnic minorities in different areas of social life, Member States have a duty to develop policies aiming at ensuring equal access and avoiding discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is another matter of concern. Sometimes different treatment on the grounds of nationality may be considered as indirect ethnic discrimination. It happens when policy concerning citizenship is aimed at excluding those of minority backgrounds – Roma or Russians, for example.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that the European courts, as well as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which stated that there should not be racial or ethnic discrimination on access to nationality, will not be less progressive and will monitor carefully the impact of policy concerning nationality on persons belonging to different ethnic groups.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while the anti-discrimination directive is a very good directive and of considerable ethical value, a number of European countries are doing little or nothing at all to transpose the directive and its content into their own law, and in practice racial and ethnic abuse is the order of the day. Italy, for instance, is facing infringement proceedings by the European Union for its failure to transpose this Directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union contends in particular that Italy has failed to transpose the notion of racial harassment into national law, lacks a law reversing the burden of proof, and has no specific provisions to protect against racial and ethnic abuse. Last December, in Opera, a municipality close to Milan, a group of citizens led by the leaders of the national Lega di Alleanza literally hunted down and set fire to tents sheltering thirty or so Roma children. In Pavia, dozens of Roma were chased off with shouts of ‘gas chambers’. On the outskirts of Rome, only a few days ago, 40 hooded attackers armed with sticks, knives and Molotov cocktails attacked a Roma camp in Ponte Mammolo during the night.</p>
      <p sl="it">In Italy, almost every day, one or more travellers’ camps are cleared by the local authorities, without the Roma having the most elementary rights. Is this the particular social protection for which the report calls, especially following enlargement, for the Roma? I would also like to stress that the sanctions applicable to breaches of national provisions adopted in accordance with the Directive must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. I would also point out that on 25 April, we approved …</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am afraid my views on this report are somewhat at odds with what has been said in the House so far, because I find this report strange, strange anyway for an institution that calls itself democratic, because on the basis of a highly questionable directive recommendations are being made which to my mind conflict with fundamental rights and freedoms and in some respects run contrary to fundamental principles of the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The truth is that real discrimination against minorities in Europe or real racism is, fortunately, a very marginal phenomenon which is already adequately and very properly combated. This report is about something quite different. What we have here is an umpteenth attempt at introducing rules which will further muzzle and imperil freedom of expression, creating a climate of increasing mental terror in which people native to a country end up being obliged to discriminate positively in favour of those of non-native stock. This is yet another report that discriminates against the non-immigrant.</p>
      <p sl="nl">So I particularly see reversal of the burden of proof in matters of discrimination and litigation, especially in employment cases, as utterly reprehensible in countries founded on the rule of law where you are deemed innocent until proved guilty.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In short, this report is not concerned with discrimination; it is a kind of legalisation of political correctness.</p>

      <p sl="sk">To being with, allow me to thank Mrs Buitenweg for the work she has done on this report. Allow me also to look at this issue from another angle.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Increasing mobility of people is compelling us to be more open to those who come to our countries. However, this openness starts with family upbringing. It is in the family that children are most likely to learn to respect others. The family is the first community that should teach openness, respect and solidarity. Educating against racial and ethnic intolerance must become a visible pillar of all aspects of upbringing and education, both in school and society as a whole. Upbringing and education must concentrate on the ethical bases that strengthen family unity.</p>
      <p sl="sk">For this reason, the issue of interaction between cultures, like that of peace and respect for diversity, have now become political and security issues of great importance. The fight against racial discrimination focuses mainly on the manner in which we wish to ensure co-existence between peoples and nations at the beginning of the new century and millennium. Naturally, some legislation is necessary, but our society should deal with racial and ethnic discrimination in such a way that we honestly assess the past and together seek a future for every human being where the dignity and intrinsic rights of each person are respected.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you, Mr President. If 60% of people surveyed feel that they are subject to some sort of unfair discrimination, then this is a warning to the Member States and a warning to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin is still alive, and it is to be feared that this will continue to be the case for a long time, since Europe is becoming increasingly diverse and ethnic differences are becoming more visible, and even countries that consider themselves mono-ethnic are becoming home to increasingly diverse cultures.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Mrs Buitenweg’s excellent report provides an opportunity for assessment and reflection. Today, meanwhile, the Commission has brought us a promise of progress in this regard since if several countries have failed to implement the Directive appropriately, then the warning is justified and help is vitally needed. Almost every one of my fellow Members has said that if citizens are unaware of their right to protection from discrimination, they will be unable to exercise this right.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Discrimination on racial or ethnic grounds raises problems in a broader context too, since belonging to an ethnic minority is primarily a question of identity. We in Eastern/Central Europe have not had a very positive experience as regards willingness to supply data, to the point where a person is a ‘Gypsy’ if his milieu considers him to be one, and this tends to be a matter of lifestyle rather than one of genuine racial identity. The Agency for Fundamental Rights will be able to do a great deal to improve this situation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I have two other comments. First, implementation of the Directive can go a long way towards ensuring that the Roma community does not drift outside Europe. Second: with the new Member States, new ethnic blocks have emerged on the map of European history. It is a sad legacy of the 20th century and the two world wars that contradictions continue to live on, and wounds have not yet healed. We are all responsible. Thank you, Mr President.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome very much the Commission taking infringement proceedings against 14 Member States for failure to properly implement the Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am chastened to see that my own state, the UK, is on the list. One of the issues in the case of my country is that the definition of indirect discrimination does not comply. Clearly there is no room for complacency, even in a country that has had legislation against race discrimination for over 40 years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Strong political will is needed on this subject, which makes it all the more disappointing that the Council did not think this debate important enough for it to be represented.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was very interested to hear the statistic quoted by Commissioner Michel that three out of four Europeans are willing for data on ethnic origin to be collected on an anonymous basis, and I welcome the fact that the Commission has done a lot of work in this area in recent years and produced a guide for best practice. We have come a very long way since 1999, when I dared put the words ‘ethnic monitoring’ in my draft report on the European Year against Racism and got whole bucketloads of objections.</p>
      <p sl="en">I obviously agree with Mr Gaubert that we have to watch carefully that ethnic and racial data collected for purposes of highlighting and fighting discrimination does not itself become a tool of discrimination through racial or ethnic profiling.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to ask the Commissioner to what extent, besides data protection safeguards, the police in their operations – which are, of course, a supply of services – fall within the scope of the discrimination ban, such as in their conduct of stop-and-search operations. The police as employers clearly fall within that scope, but I have never been entirely clear to what extent the Directive applies to police operations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, when looking at the situation as regards implementation of European Union Directives, including the Directive introducing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, I have found, as did the rapporteur, that many Member States have taken this Directive on board to a considerable extent, even going beyond the scope that it covers. With insignificant exceptions, Member States have given considerable attention to the full range of equal treatment between persons. Certain gaps and oversights remain that need additional work. Sometimes the regulations are contained in various legislative acts, but this should not create a barrier for the law to be implemented on the national level.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that the legislative framework in the European Union is on a good level. What is more of a problem is the consciousness of people who may allow themselves to discriminate against third parties. At this time, however, we have to find an answer to the following question: how can we develop people’s consciousness and sensitivity in our global world? In a world where, for many different reasons, people are constantly changing their places of residence …</p>

Of course discrimination on grounds of race or origin is reprehensible. The question is whether that discrimination is as widespread as people would always have us believe. The latest annual report of EUMC, the European Union Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, talks of an increase in the phenomenon, but cannot give concrete figures to back this up. EUMC cannot even provide a generally accepted definition of what discrimination is.</p>
      <p sl="nl">All too often the assumption is that virtually all problems involving immigrants are the result of alleged discrimination against them. This has disastrous effects, because it absolves whole population groups from personal responsibility. This policy of molly-coddling and the culture of victimhood have only made the problem worse, and I am happy to endorse the minority position expressed by Koenraad Dillen.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, first of all, please allow me to express my appreciation of the consistency and quality of this report, as well as to point out the importance of the subject for the improvement of people’s lives and the development of communities. In my speech, I would like to draw attention to the importance of education in implementing the European principles and provisions in the field of equality of treatment for individuals.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The report correctly emphasizes the fact that laws are effective only when citizens are aware of their own rights. It still remains a requirement to inform citizens, but also to educate them in order to respond; in fact, in order for them to defend themselves. It is only when people have the courage to speak, write and resort to their rights that discrimination phenomena can be limited.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, education for tolerance is extremely important for the survival of any community. Learning to live with other people, to accept differences not like a fatality, but like an opportunity to build the whole, means following the right path towards eradicating this type of phenomena.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the European Union has good laws, established anti-discriminatory standards, and directives are in preparation. I would like to congratulate my colleague on the report that she has presented today. In turn, Member States introduce that which is decided here. States have anti-discrimination clauses in their constitutions and they have entire sections of law that are supposed to protect the citizen from discrimination. Why then is the current situation so bad? Why is it that there are still so many examples of discrimination, which we are unable to deal with?</p>
      <p sl="pl">It seems to me that the problem lies on two levels. Firstly, information, and, secondly, implementation of obligations. I would like to focus on information. Information is not just the responsibility of governments. As it turns out, governments do not provide much information to ordinary people about the nature of discrimination. It seems to me that this role should be taken over to a greater degree by non-governmental organisations, which are well placed to deal with specific areas of society, specific groups of citizens, and to provide them with information about what immigration means. Just ask immigrants, older women, single mothers, whether they feel they are discriminated against. They say: ‘No, it’s just our destiny. It’s just bad luck’. They need help to find themselves; they need help with procedures and appropriate authorities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like the European Parliament to get involved in preparing a code of practice that would be given to different organisations. I would like to say one last thing. I hope that the European Commission project involving the yellow lorry travelling round Europe with an anti-discrimination exhibition and the European Year of Equal Opportunities do not represent the full extent of what we can do. Let us do more to help those who are subject to discrimination.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the introduction of a principle such as equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, as also irrespective of their skin colour, creed or religion, generally involves ongoing and unceasing activity. Any step of progress towards the goal can be counted as a great success. We cannot expect to change the attitudes of everyone overnight, that everyone should rid themselves of their natural condition, which is to improve their lives and fight against whatever could potentially endanger that improvement. However, we must do everything to remove legal, sociological and economic barriers, provide education, create conditions for harmonious coexistence and change our negative attitudes towards other people, whatever the differences between us. Finally, I would like to say that I absolutely do not agree with the statement made by Mr Vanhecke regarding attitudes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in welcoming this Commission communication, I regret that, despite this and other legislation, discrimination across the EU has not decreased but has increased dramatically.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to respond to those from the far right who challenge this because, let me tell you, that this year alone, I have met around 500 people from the Sikh community from France, from Belgium, from Italy, from Germany, all citing shocking cases of unacceptable discrimination against them because of their appearance: because they wear a turban.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since 2004, there have been a number of Sikh boys who have been expelled from schools in France for not removing their turban. There are similar cases in Belgium and Germany.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst the French High Court ruled that Sikh men could wear their turban on their driving licence ID photo, the French Ministry, within 24 hours of this verdict, expressly forbade it.</p>
      <p sl="en">At Brussels Airport, Sikh men are regularly asked to remove their turbans, which is considered a major insult.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, I receive weekly calls from Italy about people unable to go about their daily business because they are Sikhs. So these cases are clearly a violation of everything that this report is asking for and what the Commission is propagating.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I would like to ask the Commissioner what he and the Commission are doing to challenge these cases of discrimination. We cannot talk about unity and diversity and then ignore practices of governments of many Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to congratulate Ms Buitenweg, the rapporteur on this report, for bringing forward measures that I hope will give some redress to those who are being marginalised because of ignorance and because of a lack of awareness and respect for other people’s culture.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I sincerely hope that in this year of equal opportunity, and next year of intercultural dialogue, we have the will to ensure that our deeds reflect our words.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is clear that, in the 21st century, no one can do other than support the struggle against discrimination. I too am in favour of this report, although I believe that prejudices are based on culture, civilisation and religion, rather than race or ethnicity. I would like to add, by the way, that it would be easier for us in Europe to abide by principles of non-discrimination if we introduced controlled immigration policies for people that we wanted in our countries, as, in principle, no one will act in an aggressive and unfriendly manner to a partner that they chose themselves.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This report basically speaks about the rights of immigrants. However, let us also consider their responsibilities. It would be easier not to show discrimination to foreigners and people from other cultures if they showed respect for the culture and traditions of the people in the country to which they have come, and if they showed a desire to integrate and did not create a state within a state in our Europe, which has, and we must face the facts, its roots in Christianity.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am grateful to Mrs Buitenweg for the outstanding job she has done on this report. Discrimination and racism on all fronts, whether in the job market, in sports clubs or at school, is an attack on the values which we in Europe hold dear. What we need is a combined approach at all levels, European, national and local. Legislators, politicians and victims of discrimination themselves all have an important part to play here. We must make Europe’s citizens aware of their rights and the means at their disposal for insisting on those rights.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I urge the Commission to act on its responsibilities and see to it that the Racial Equality Directive is implemented promptly and properly. The Directive is a step in the right direction, but its efficacy depends on how well it is implemented by Member States. And I call on the Commission to show the moral leadership which Barroso himself announced in 2004, and which is sorely needed. Discrimination is still a routine occurrence in Europe in 2007, the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. Now above all, at a time when some groups are certainly not having an easy ride – I am thinking particularly of the position of Muslims in Europe – we need people who will stand up against discrimination and be counted in all areas.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I too would like to see the Commission extend anti-discrimination measures to all conceivable forms of discrimination.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on preparing a report that I hope will help to protect people from racial and ethnic discrimination as well as achieve greater success in obtaining legal redress.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We have much work to do in seeking to effectively implement the directives on ethnic and employment equality. The citizens of the EU Member States (especially the new ones) still do not know their rights; either they do not have enough time, or it is financially impossible for them to defend their rights. In the majority of countries, those suffering from discrimination do not manage to join forces and appoint more powerful associations to defend their collective rights. It is difficult to collect information on these thorny issues identifying indirect discrimination or assessing the extent of discrimination in society. Therefore, the European Commission faces problems in supervising the implementation of directives and determining the reasons for the miserable situations in which discrimination exists.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I support my colleagues’ recommendations to allocate more resources to non-governmental organisations that inform citizens and provide legal aid for the victims of discrimination. The role of the media is also very important.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Thus, I would like to address my colleagues. We all have offices in the countries in which we are elected. There we could provide and finance initial legal consultations during which people would be informed about the legal acts prohibiting discrimination and the possibilities of making use of the right of legal redress. In short, we could help people directly.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We could more actively mobilise the political will to strengthen the fight against racial discrimination and employment inequality.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by assuring you that I will, of course, convey to my colleague Vladimir Špidla the broadly positive comments that I have heard in relation to his efforts. I believe the appreciation is justified and I will certainly pass it on. I will obviously transmit to him, too, the European Parliament’s comments and its urgent requests, or expectations, with regard to the work that remains to be done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to make one thing clear at the outset. I certainly do not share – and the Commission does not share – certain views that have been expressed reflecting a tendency towards exclusion, and I am glad to say that they are marginal. Similarly, I feel bound to comment on the claim that there is a risk of creating a state within the Christian state, or within Christian Europe. It goes without saying that I have the fullest respect for the individual citizens who think along such lines, but I feel bound nonetheless – and I do see it as a duty – to remind you quite simply that Europe does not speak with one voice, religiously, philosophically or politically. I believe that stating the obvious like this is sometimes worthwhile.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mrs Buitenweg and Mrs In ’t Veld rightly pointed to a fundamental problem, namely transposition of the directives into national law. The Commission is fully aware that we need to keep up the pressure on those Member States which have not yet complied with the European legislation. The Commission shares this concern with the bodies that oversee these important matters in the Member States; as you know, of course, we provide firm and willing support to those equality bodies and organisations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the new initiative, we are currently assessing its impact: the process of studying its effects on discrimination has already begun. Obviously we need to know the extent of the problem. Consultations are currently in progress with the general public, with NGOs and the social partners, within companies and at the European Parliament. All being well, we will have a report on the impact assessment in January 2008. The next step will be inter-service consultation in March and April 2008. The initiative will be included in the Commission’s 2008 work programme, which is currently under consideration and is to be published in late October or early November. If it is adopted as proposed, the Commission will receive a proposal in June 2008, and the procedure should then take its course.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So there we have it: it goes without saying that our thinking and our analysis are closely akin to that of the Members who spoke in the debate – or at least the majority of them – and I should like, on behalf of the Commission, to congratulate Mrs Buitenweg on her excellent work. I think that what we have seen here is an example of just how crucial Parliament’s role can be in promoting a rights-based Europe that respects its minorities and, indeed, all its citizens.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I would like to congratulate my fellow Member Mrs Kathalijne Buitenweg on the report she has produced, and at the same time draw attention to a number of important problems.</p>
      <p sl="hu">European citizens’ awareness of the law is rather limited, and the very people who are victims of unfair discrimination, in other words ethnic minorities – and particularly the Roma –, are almost completely unaware of the relevant legal provisions or the structures that offer them legal protection. This is why so few discrimination cases are taken to court in the European Union. Moreover, the financial penalties imposed in such cases are ridiculously low, especially compared with similar proceedings conducted in the United States. Member States should have a responsibility and an obligation to inform and educate the public to ensure that as many citizens as possible across society are aware of their rights and possibilities.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Equality bodies operate at a distance from citizens; it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that they only operate on paper, without active participation on the part of those affected. Another problem is that, to be able to operate, these bodies depend to a major extent on the governments of the Member States in terms of financing, infrastructure, human resources and policy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We need to establish an efficient, European-level system of accountability and monitoring and to make the annual reports more systematic, enabling us to observe whether equality bodies are functioning independently.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The report on equality between women and men in 2007 offers an occasion firstly for saluting the European Union’s commitment to women’s rights, which goes all the way back to 1957. However, as shown by recent statistics compiled when Romania and Bulgaria joined the Union, we can scarcely be content with the situation as it stands.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the first place, access to the labour market and status in the labour market remain, for far too many women, largely aspirational. Thirty-two years after the Council Directive requiring that women and men should receive the same pay for the same work, the gap is still too wide, at 15% on average.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, achieving gender equality will require greater efforts to combat exclusion and unequal treatment, especially in rural areas where women who work alongside farmers – as assisting spouses – can suffer serious injustice in the event of divorce or in relation to property inheritance or access to property. Nor are these women always taken into account in statistical analyses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need, as a matter of urgency, to give practical effect to various pieces of legislation. Part of the European Union’s role in this vitally important struggle is also to ensure, through awareness raising and more effective prevention, that national cultures evolve and converge.</p>

    <intervention id="4-037" speaker_id="4258" name="Piia-Noora Kauppi" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly I would like to express my gratitude to the Commission for drafting this very important report. Equality between women and men is an issue that continues to deserve our full attention. Although much has been achieved in the past decades, important challenges remain.</p>
      <p sl="en">The focus of the Commission report is on employment issues. For example, the gender pay gap, insecurity in the job market and the reconciliation of professional and family life are issues that have a bearing on the lives of millions of women every single day. They are also clearly linked to the demographic challenge facing Europe. As the Commission report indicates, six million of the eight million jobs created in the EU since 2000 have been taken up by women. Most of these six million new jobs for women come from the services sector. The 11.7 million new jobs created by the services sector are mostly occupied by women. That is why the services sector, its growth and the internal market are such a key issue for many women in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the majority of new jobs for women are part-time jobs, some of them unsafe and insecure with low salaries. Fixed-term contracts are also a big problem for many women in Europe, who would like to have more sustainability and stability in their family life as well. Commission figures show that, in the EU, 32% of women in employment have a part-time job, compared to only 7% of men, so there is clearly a gender dimension in the part-time job market in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The gender pay gap, on which the Commission issued an initiative in July, is 15% on average across the EU, and up to 30% in some European countries. The gender pay gap has not decreased, although directives on the principle of equal pay for men and women have been in place for more than 30 years, so it is very timely that the Commission has taken up this issue. On the other hand, we know that Member States that have adopted policies reconciling professional and family life for both women and men have higher birth rates, a higher percentage of women in the labour market and higher employment rates.</p>
      <p sl="en">Across the EU, women also hold the majority of highly-skilled, non-manual jobs. This week there was quite wide coverage of a Finnish study about women leaders in business. A total of 14 000 Finnish companies were looked at and women business leaders made a 1% better return every year for the stakeholders of companies than male leaders. That is 10% better than men. Even though all the other things were removed from the calculation, there was clearly an advantage for women in business leadership, so this is also something that the Commission is going to take into account in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Finland, as in other countries, education has been the key for female advancement. The rise in educational standards has gone hand in hand with increased female employment. In Finland, for example, 32.7% of women are highly skilled, compared to only 24.3% of men, according to the Commission study. So all the initiatives in the field of education and life-long learning that the Commission has tabled are needed and it is very important that we keep education focused on gender policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">My report calls for specific measures to combat inequalities caused by interrupted patterns of employment resulting from maternity leave and leave to take care of dependants. It caused the Commission to develop gender analyses on the impact of pension reforms on women’s lives in the EU with the objective of individualising pension rights as well as the social security and tax system. What I find particularly important is that the report urges Member States to mutualise the cost of maternity leave allowance in order to ensure that women no longer represent a more costly source of labour than men. I certainly hope that my own Member State, which has a world record Government of 60% women ministers, will take on board this issue and mutualise paternity/maternity leave costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also underlines the need to address the major democratic deficit. We want to investigate the situation that prevents women’s participation in politics and in senior management in public administration at all levels and, if possible, take measures to combat such situations. Attention must also be paid to the situation of women belonging to ethnic minorities and women immigrants, as their marginalisation is reinforced by multiple discrimination from both outside and within their own communities. I urge the Commission to cooperate with Member States to collect relevant data and to enforce measures that would prevent human trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced labour.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that we can finish on a very positive and encouraging note. Women today have opportunities that most of their mothers and grandmothers could never have dreamt of. Women who are reaping the benefits of the brave new world should speak out, and I think that it was very important that the Commission took the initiative to table this report. We continue to fight for full equality for both genders in Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="4-038" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mrs Kauppi, Members of the House, obviously the Commission warmly welcomes this report and the motion for a resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union. Adoption of the report will underscore Parliament’s commitment to gender equality. I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Kauppi, as the rapporteur, for the fact that the text expresses support for the European Commission’s approach and the measures it is taking to promote equality between women and men.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the first place, gender equality is one of the founding values of the European Union. It is also an area in which Europe has led the way, in many cases anticipating developments in society. Over the past few years, a number of important and ambitious initiatives have been launched. The adoption of the Roadmap for equality between women and men highlighted the Commission’s unstinting commitment to push forward resolutely on all fronts in pursuit of effective equality between women and men in every field.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission welcomes the emphasis that Parliament’s resolution places on certain themes which the Roadmap also identifies as priority areas for action, particularly equality between women and men in terms of economic independence, the reconciliation of working and private lives, the balance of gender representation in decision-making posts, and the need to combat stereotypes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While there has undoubtedly been progress in the pursuit of equality between women and men, major challenges clearly remain. The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that we must continue our efforts and consolidate what has been achieved. The Commission is aware, in this respect, of the importance of applying the acquis communautaire effectively, and it will determinedly pursue its role as guardian of the Treaties. It will not hesitate to initiate infringement proceedings if it believes that a European directive has not been properly transposed. There are several current examples of infringement procedures under way, at various stages, in relation to equality between women and men.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to improve compliance with Community law, the Commission has set up a network – known as the Network of Equality Bodies – linking the organisations responsible at national level for promoting equality in the treatment of women and men. The Commission believes that pooling of their respective national-level experience and closer cooperation with the Commission itself can make the various equality bodies more effective in their role of promoting equality of treatment and ensuring that the national agencies responsible for interpreting the legislation do so more uniformly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report also emphasises the central importance of reconciling working and private lives in the process of achieving real equality between men and women. This reflects the Commission’s own thinking. We are well aware that, in the majority of households, family and domestic responsibilities continue to be borne by women. Women are thus more likely than men to have to interrupt, or indeed abandon, their education or career, and this inevitably spawns gender inequalities in relation to work, as well as eroding women’s productive potential. Providing accessible, affordable childcare services of high quality is crucially important as a means of boosting the female employment rate – a point made in the Barcelona objectives. The Commission is to report in 2008 on progress towards these objectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has also undertaken a process of consultation with the social partners on the reconciliation of working and private lives, the second phase of which concluded at the end of July. In the Commission’s view, this is a complex question that needs to be addressed through a whole range of instruments. At the same time, however, existing Community legislation could be amended to take better account of the challenges that Europe must address. The Commission is currently studying the social partners’ responses to the consultation, and it will use these as a basis for taking the necessary steps. We will also continue to support exchanges of good practice in this field, as reflected in the draft resolution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would reiterate here that respect for the principle of equality between all women and all men is one of the European Union’s fundamental values. That being so, the question of balanced participation by women and men in decision-making is absolutely crucial. It is therefore one of the priorities in the Roadmap for equality between women and men which the Commission adopted last year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to conclude by emphasising how important it is to combat stereotyping, a point made several times in the report. Stereotypes probably constitute the toughest obstacle in the way of equality between women and men, and combating them demands effort beyond the contexts of legislation and financial measures: it is about changing forms of behaviour, attitudes and values that determine and influence men’s and women’s roles in society and the career choices they make. Equality policy has always been a driver of change in behaviour and ways of thinking, and it will continue to play that role. The Commission warmly welcomes Parliament’s support in the shape of this motion for a resolution.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is vital for their legal status as women working in agriculture to be fully recognised, for equal rights and opportunities to become effective, including in social security. Motherhood must be given effective protection and there needs to be better access to healthcare, education, lifelong learning, facilities for children and families, especially nurseries, local cultural centres and markets, all of which requires more investment and better public services in rural areas. This is the only way to combat the high levels of poverty and isolation affecting women in some rural areas and to achieve better social cohesion.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, more women now work, but unfortunately a disproportionate number work in insecure jobs. That means women have to be flexible yet are paid little. The triple C jobs are mainly reserved for women: C for cleaning, C for caring and C for cashiering in supermarkets and shopping malls. Yet we women want triple M jobs: M for money – equal pay for equal work – M for management – more and more women are highly trained so they should have no difficulty in penetrating the glass ceiling to management – and, finally, M for motherhood – yes, we want to be able to combine job, career and motherhood, and for that we need considerably more political support.</p>
      <p sl="de">We do not just need more childcare places, as stated in the Barcelona objectives. No, we need childcare of the highest quality. All mothers and fathers must be able to afford childcare and the Community must fund it. It is not just the children of well-to-do parents who should receive maximum support from a very early age onwards. We do not just need equal rights for men and women, we also need equal rights for all children. Education and training do not begin at school, but much earlier. We have to change our way of thinking here.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to congratulate Mrs Kauppi for this report, which offers a snapshot of the current situation in the world of work in Europe. While we have had various opportunities to look at this issue in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, Mrs Kauppi has helped to pinpoint, and to shed light on, a problem, and that problem is that in Europe there is once again a wage gap in the world of women, a difference in pay for equal work which cannot be tolerated.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is the case even though school attendance rates among women are high, women now account for 59% of European graduates, women’s participation in the working world has increased significantly, and women are now gaining a great deal of recognition for the results that they are obtaining. What I believe is more important, however, is that the report highlights some of the features which continue to make women’s participation in the working world difficult, with the result that this is happening in practice without any justification – and runs counter to European laws and the laws of the Member States, which prohibit different wages in the working world. This is not just happening in the south of Europe, as is usually said, but throughout Europe, even in the Nordic countries, even in those countries in which tradition leads us to accept that women’s participation in the working world and the institutions is nowadays better consolidated and better recognised.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe, therefore, focusing on one of the questions raised by Mrs Kauppi, whether full mutualisation of the costs of maternity benefits and parental leave should be general practice in the Member States, that those costs, while they are still partly borne by firms, encourage employers to recruit smaller numbers of female staff, which, in turn, has an impact on their careers.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, in thanking the rapporteur for her fine report I want to stress, first of all, the harmony that has marked the joint endeavours of all the European institutions on gender equality policies throughout 2007. The strong commitment of our institutions to gender equality, as shown by the European Pact for Gender Equality adopted by the European Council and the Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men in force until 2010, is highly commendable.</p>
      <p sl="es">As to the indicators referred to in the report, and bearing in mind the report for the previous year, the lack of significant progress towards equal pay for equal work, which Mrs Sartori has just mentioned, is regrettable and rightly criticised in the report. The gender pay gap in the European Union continues at 15%; to narrow it will require a greater effort in the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="es">An encouraging item of information in the report is that six of the eight million jobs created in the European Union since 2000 have been filled by women, although there are considerable age differences that also need correcting.</p>
      <p sl="es">A crucial point arising from the report is the importance of equality policies in relation to the demographic challenge facing Europe. It is a fact that those Member States that have adopted policies aimed at reconciling private and working life for women and men have higher birth rates, a higher percentage of women in the labour market and higher employment rates.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is also a matter of concern that older women and mothers in single-parent families continue to be the groups at the greatest risk of exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, may I point out, along with the report, that it would be interesting and very useful if future annual reports on equality between women and men included statistics for candidate countries, which could then be used in the negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my congratulations to Mrs Kauppi on an important report.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Gender equality is one of the EU’s fundamental principles, as Commissioner Michel also said, but it is just one basic principle ‘on show’ in speeches and declarations such as these. In reality the EU is not very interested in equality between women and men. That was obvious in the Commissioner’s speech too. He said that the EU will do all it can. There is nothing very concrete there. What will the EU do to ensure that the directives it has adopted on equal pay and many other issues are actually implemented?</p>
      <p sl="fi">In my opinion, the EU should actually wake up to the fact that men and women should have more equal status in Europe. The EU talks a lot, but does less, and the Member States also talk a lot but do less. In fact this issue does not shake people into action, at least not the EU’s leaders. I suppose that is just as true for the top decision-makers and the labour market organisations in our own countries. There are other more important things. It is also conspicuous in the fact that the pay gap is still at a level of 15% in the EU countries generally and in my country, a pioneer in the matter of equality, it is, regrettably, 20%.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I hope the Commissioner and the Commission as a whole will one day realise and recognise the importance of this and do something about promoting the EU principle of equality between women and men. Today it is just empty words.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report. There are many points in it to which I would like to refer, but I shall focus on two that seem to me the most pertinent.</p>
      <p sl="es">First, I welcome the fact that the Commission’s report for 2007 concentrates on employment issues such as the pay gap, conciliation and the directives on equal treatment, given that the economic independence of women is one of the priorities in the Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is quite true – as the Commission’s report says – that six of the eight million jobs created in the European Union since 2000 are occupied by women. This would be a clearly positive development, were it not for the fact that the majority of the new jobs occupied by women are part-time; many are insecure and badly paid, and hold out little prospect of wage increases.</p>
      <p sl="es">The report also points out that there has been no significant progress in reducing the gender pay gap: that must give cause for concern when the average pay for women is 15% lower than that of men, and in some countries as much as 30% lower.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second point I wish to emphasise concerns a particular category of women, those working in agriculture. There is a need to improve the legal situation of such women, both with regard to social security, to which they should be guaranteed direct access, and with regard to their role in agricultural holdings, where a strong stand must be taken on the co-ownership of family holdings, access to credit and succession rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission should pay special attention to both these issues. In concrete terms, it must redouble its efforts to achieve greater equality between women and men in respect of treatment and opportunities.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, let me thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, and all others who have committed themselves to this work. A major problem which I would like to highlight in the work on equality is that too many people today believe that we have equal opportunities. That is sometimes true in theory, but we have a long way to go when it comes to equal opportunities in practice. This resolution draws attention to this fact and puts forward good proposals on what can be done and what in fact must be done now.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I have, in this Parliament too, repeatedly demanded and highlighted the need for statistics broken down by sex in all areas. Only when we see the facts can we bring about change. If we cannot, by revealing the facts, document the great differences which exist between the sexes, they will be ignored. Besides, people do not realise how extensive they really are. It is therefore a self-evident demand which I repeat: all statistics must be broken down by sex.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I also want to highlight my great concern, and that of my political group as a whole, about the difference in employment between women and men as regards paid work; we all know that the unpaid work is done by women. At the same time as we see figures showing an increase in vacancies for women, we also see what type of employment is involved. The majority of the new jobs for women are casual, insecure part-time positions and low-wage jobs. We must put an end to this situation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the report on equality between women and men is additional proof that equal rights policies have an important role to play. Both women and men have the right to play an active part in all areas of public life and have the right to have this enshrined in law. Dignity is not, however, experienced just through legislative acts, but also through appropriate levels of material, spiritual and emotional support, especially within a healthy family structure.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately contemporary propaganda devalues the role of marriage, the family and the mother and instils a feeling of guilt in those girls and women who want to stay at home and look after children. Instead of providing assistance, legal protection, instead of valuing the role of the wife and the mother bringing up children, there is an objectification of women, they are overloaded with expectations, and this is compounded by widely propagated views concerning contraception, abortion, extreme individualism, conflict between parents and children and even by extending retirement age, which leads to mental and physical breakdown.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is important constantly to remind people that equality, equal rights of women and men, does not mean being the same as men. All forms of masculinisation of women, competing with men on every level, impoverishes not just women, but also society as a whole, and it distorts the richness and inner value of both femininity and masculinity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Particular sensitivity is needed today to avoid actions that are divorced from people’s real needs and aspirations and to overcome the excesses of individualism and moral relativism. It is vital, especially in situations where there is no basic infrastructure for economic growth, to combat discrimination in many areas of life. For this reason, social organisations as well as laws should provide assistance in fulfilling our obligations, instead of indoctrination and unification that create unrest and conflict. This is why I am calling for the dignity of every human being to be respected, not just with regard to equal pay, but also as regards respect for traditions, cultures, religions and values that are important to national and cultural identity, which will enrich contemporary Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, colleagues, the report before us today is largely an exercise in stating the obvious. In it we find the same familiar statistics concerning employment rates, wage gaps and types of job. We also find never-ending descriptions of the persistence of gender-based stereotypes and the resulting discrimination reflected in women’s absence from certain sectors of the labour market. I am thinking in particular of advanced technology, the sciences, research and engineering.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet the report contains an apparent contradiction. How can we welcome globalisation in paragraph 17 – hailing its positive effects on women’s access to education, care, health and employment, whether at home, in sub-contracting or in micro-enterprises – and at the same time, in paragraph 18, highlight the negative impact of globalisation with the feminisation of poverty? Which paragraph are we to take seriously?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Elsewhere the report recommends pan-European measures to increase awareness of zero tolerance for sexist insults. But what constitutes a sexist insult? Was Ségolène Royal, who contested the last French presidential election, the victim of a sexist insult when one of her former Socialist comrades said she was not the best candidate for the highest office in the land? Or was that no more than a criticism, or simply an opinion?</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is dangerous to base legislation on a notion like this that has no legal definition and cannot have one. Moreover, we are dealing here with an area that is essentially subjective and non-rational.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, once again we are getting annoyed about statistics demonstrating that although women achieve better results, their salaries are permanently 15% lower. Yes, we have a glass ceiling and men do not like women taking up senior posts very much. Stereotypes exist and women themselves sometimes become their victims. We want to change this. However, my opinion is that if we want to change something we have to start here.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The employment statistics for the European Parliament and for the Commission clearly show that men are in an overwhelming majority when it comes to the best-paid posts. Women prevail in the lowest-paid posts. There are many highly efficient female linguists with third-level education who work here for the salary of a secretary. Their better-paid bosses have mostly two types of qualification: they are men and they have been here a long time.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, I am of the opinion that recommendations by the European institutions on gender issues will be taken seriously only when we carry out a thorough analysis of the relation between reward systems and people’s education and efficiency, and when human resources management and pay systems are revised. Until this happens, the citizens will see us as people who preach water and drink wine.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, we are celebrating both the 50th anniversary of the founding treaty of a United Europe and 50 years of progress in guaranteeing equality between men and women. The culmination of the latter is the horizontal reference to this in all spheres of action of the European Commission and of dialogue with civil society.</p>
      <p sl="el">Hidden inequalities between men and women continue to exist in the policies and practices of the EU Member States. We need analysis and assessment of the negative circumstances that give rise to these inequalities. The report by my dear colleague, Mrs Kauppi, whom I congratulate, lists many actions to counter partial discrimination against women.</p>
      <p sl="el">I would like particularly to emphasise the measures to promote equal participation by men and women in support of the family as a basic factor in economic development, prosperity and the social cohesion of the EU. Gender equality ought to benefit those women who voluntarily wish to remain at home, for a long or a short time, in order to look after children, the elderly and dependants. The fact that these women have been out of work should not expose them to discrimination over pensions and social welfare rights.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioner, I am very disappointed with the position of Greek women. According to press reports, you have brought infringement proceedings against my country to eliminate the more flexible age conditions applying to women. Why cannot an early award of pensions for daughters and mothers be an exchange for what they contribute to their families?</p>
      <p sl="el">Equality – yes, Commissioner, but not balance. The Member States, the EU and the social partners can make good use of the newly-created European Alliance for Families: best practices and pioneering approaches for policies that are family-friendly can be promoted. They will keep pace with national policies and thus promote equality.</p>
      <p sl="el">The EU’s demographic problem demands that equal opportunities be granted to men and women. With regard to parental leave, the relevant directive agreed upon solely between the Commission and the social partners requires revision, and you have promised, Commissioner, that this revision will take place in 2008.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, a commitment by the private sector to employ young women and with regard to the sacking of young mothers is also required. The productivity and development of the EU, Commissioner, require the creation of a mechanism to monitor discrimination of this kind. We hope that you will take immediate action.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can assure Mrs Kauppi of the full support of our Socialist Group on all the points she addressed in her report. The equality report is appearing during the year of equal opportunities for all, and we can also mark 50 years of equality policy in the European Union. Unless pressure is exerted and things change, women will no longer trust the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was also announced that the year 2007 would see the setting up of the European Institute for Gender Equality. What is the situation as regards appointments to the Board? Here our Parliament has a right of say. Where are preparations actually under way to ensure that the Vilnius institute can become operational before the year is out?</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU has not made use of its key competences in the field of equal pay – a major area, which has been addressed by many female colleagues. I find it scandalous that 15% of women are still paid less for their work than men. Sweden is the only country where things look better, with a figure of just 10%. In my country, Germany, the figure is 26%, and I am no longer prepared to tolerate that. This is a case where the Commission has to muster up the courage to exert pressure on the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Reconciling professional and family life: Mr Špidla has taken measures in that area. I am glad. We support the fact that fathers are also having to do their share. Undertakings also bear great responsibility here. That is why our Group has launched a Europe-wide campaign of support.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of measures we take under, for instance, the Structural Funds. A recent hearing in the Committee on Regional Development showed that hardly any account has been taken to date of the fact that women benefit far less from the EU budget than men. Gender budgeting is, therefore, another key demand of ours.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission has announced measures in two areas: the implementation of legislative measures to combat multiple discrimination and to combat violence against women. We have scarcely touched on that today, but it is a burning issue that needs to be resolved.</p>

      <p sl="et">I would like to thank the rapporteur for raising an important issue once again. I do not think that we are bursting through an open door with this report. The door may well already be open, but if there is a glass ceiling above us then we must address this issue over and over again.</p>
      <p sl="et">In my speech I would like to focus on two points. Especially when considering the fact that a policy implementing equal rights for both sexes is an important means of achieving economic development.</p>
      <p sl="et">Despite the existence de jure of equal rights in all European Union countries, de facto inequality persists in the division between men and women of power and access to economic, social and cultural resources. This is down to the continuance of prevailing customs and their influence on the unequal division of family responsibilities and the obstacles to combining work and family life which exist for most women. This, I am sorry to say, is evidence of the democratic deficit at European level.</p>
      <p sl="et">Equal participation by both sexes in decision-making is the prime prerequisite for democracy, so I shall now comment on decision-making in all walks of life. Liberals say that people’s right to make a decision themselves is the key to success. Freedom to choose, however, is attained only if women and men can make their own choices in all areas. In order for men and women, I repeat, men and women, to be able to combine work and family, we need good-quality childcare facilities, family-friendly work environments and a supportive legal framework.</p>
      <p sl="et">In addition, it is important to improve both the legal and non-legal framework and to raise the level of awareness in society. The same is also true of outdated patterns of thought, in other words women must change from being participants into decision-makers; only then will we be able to talk of a society where the interests of both sexes are represented and considered, a society which is truly democratic.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Kauppi, ladies and gentlemen, this year we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding of the EU and we can also look back over 50 years of milestones with regard to equality between women and men. Yet I find the findings of the Commission’s 2007 equality report a bitter pill to swallow. It shows that in many areas people are still only paying lip service to gender equality, and that it remains far from being a reality.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have heard many statistics quoted today – there are wide differences in the employment rates of men and women, and in many Member States women have, with few exceptions, a higher rate of unemployment. Almost one in three women work part-time. We know that women are still significantly under-represented in positions of power and leadership. It is indeed a scandal that the average wage gap is 15%, rising to as much as 27% in Germany.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am also glad that the Commission has addressed the question of obligatory parental leave for fathers. It was quite obvious that the question of reconciling family and work belongs on the Commission’s agenda. Yet in other areas of EU equality policy, the Commission seems to have switched to neutral. I say that because we have not heard any political initiatives, aside from the aforesaid parental leave for fathers, from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Institute for Gender Equality was mentioned, as was violence against women. What is the Commission doing to tackle the wage gap? I hear little more than rhetoric. It is our duty to do far more there, including gender budgeting, which has been heralded for years, but where are the indicators? So I would ask the Commission to propose ambitious legislation so that gender equality policy becomes a beacon again in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, my thanks and compliments to Mrs Kauppi on her report, but I have a few points to make to the Commission. The Commission regularly pays lip service to gender equality, and has done so again today, but time and time again it has failed in practice to turn its good intentions into concrete action. Worse still, instead of taking measures which would reduce gender inequality, combat female poverty and help women resolve the day-to-day problems they encounter, the Commission’s policy frequently makes their position even more difficult.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A good example of this is ‘flexisecurity’, measures to make the laws on redundancy more flexible. If the proposals outlined by the Commission in its Green Paper are implemented it is precisely women, who all too often are employed under short-term contracts as temps and are relatively poorly paid, who will suffer. It is women, specifically, who have a lot of problems with things like building up a pension fund, health costs and juggling family care and paid work. And what does the Commission do? Instead of giving women, indeed workers in general, the certainty which would make their lives a little bit easier, the Commission proposes to create even greater uncertainty.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This report on inequality between men and women shows that major differences still persist in 2007. A much higher priority needs to be given to overcoming this, in both word and deed. Gender equality should be automatically mainstreamed into all Commission policy. I actually find it deplorable that we have to keep on reminding the Commission of the fact.</p>

There is no understanding that much of this social engineering is largely self-defeating.</p>
      <p sl="en">The simple logic, like it or not, is that if it costs more to hire women, then fewer women will be hired, despite the rules that prevent employers from mentioning gender in job advertisements and interviews. All legislation designed to prevent discrimination against women, or old people, or minorities, has the undesirable result of demeaning those who would have achieved without the legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">All our jobs, for women and men, depend on the wealth generated by the economy. Most jobs are provided by small businesses. Well, unlike in this Parliament, out there in the real world of small business, women and men are employed and they earn money by producing goods and services that other people are happy to pay for. This obsession with promoting gender equality is just one of many sources of interference in small business. If we continue to add more cost and more restrictions, then business will hire less and pay less. In the end we might be more equal, but we shall all be poorer, both women and men.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Kauppi. We all agree on the need to increase the birth rate in Europe in order to improve the demographic situation. If this is successful, and it has to be successful, it will mean that a significant number of women, especially young women, will have to leave the job market at least temporarily. This is a problem, as already there is a shortage of workers in many parts of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For example, science in Europe is experiencing a shortfall of about 700 000 scientists. Despite this, in Europe barely one doctor in four is a woman, and only one out of ten professors. This is in a situation where, in Europe, more women than men are completing higher education. This means that they are well prepared for academic work, but they interrupt this work and do not continue with it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In each sector the incentives and facilities offered to women to take up work have to be different. For example, in education there are a number of simple steps. First of all, the possibility of doing academic work at home. Secondly, organisation of very comfortable and affordable nurseries within the walls of institutes or universities. Thirdly, childcare either by men or by women. Fourthly, the possibility of obtaining academic degrees during maternity leave. Finally, fifthly, making sure that men and women earn the same for the same job.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Europe cannot allow a situation to continue where educated and skilled women lose out in academic areas just because they give birth to children. Fortunately someone has become involved in this area.</p>
      <p sl="pl">UNESCO, together with L’Oréal, has for some years been running a project for women in the academic sector. We shall see the results, the very good results, of this project, in an exhibition opening next Monday, 1 October, in the European Parliament in Brussels, on the ground floor, opposite the KBC bank. I would like to extend a warm invitation to all of you to attend.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In 2005 in my report on the Lisbon Strategy from a gender perspective, I pointed to various forms of discrimination affecting European women.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Two years later, after many discussions and good intentions, many debates and conferences, many reports and many studies, what has changed? What progress has been made as regards the wage gap between men and women, the participation of women in the decision-making process, or as regards the reconciliation of work, family and privates lives for both men and women? Although there has been progress in some Member States, regrettably little has changed at European level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The gender pay gap continues to average around 15% and the participation of women in decision-making has risen by only 1%. Women continue to devote three times as many hours to family responsibilities as men. Nevertheless, the number of women at universities is increasing. They are gradually asserting themselves but there are still many forms of discrimination, especially when they become mothers and precisely for that reason. Perhaps this is why birth rates are so low. Women migrants and refugees, women belonging to ethnic minorities, elderly women, women with disabilities, all these groups face dual discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We need better laws, such as the equality laws that were approved in Spain and Portugal, but we also need compliance with existing laws, especially the laws on advertising so as to eliminate the degrading depiction of women in advertising and the mass media.

Women’s salaries still remain 15 percent lower than men’s salaries in the EU. Women returning to the labour market or climbing the career ladder face significant problems.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The Council Directive of 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women has not yet been implemented.

In view of the changed conditions in a globalised world we should, also at European Parliament level, encourage the Member States to modernise these systems. On the initiative of young families, it might be beneficial for Member States to consider introducing benefits during maternity leave for at least 12 months at a rate of 100% of income and during parental leave for at least 24 months at a rate of at least 50% of income, where mothers or, as the case may be, fathers look after their children on a full-time basis.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The period of maternity and parenthood is always referred to in legal language as leave despite the fact that not only mothers but also psychologists, doctors, sociologists and many other experts agree with parents that being on maternity or parental leave in no way constitutes leave. I believe that the time has come to start with the language used to speak about maternity and parenthood and to refer to maternity leave in more correct terms. When the gap in their active working lives is over, it is necessary to facilitate the unimpeded return of mothers and fathers to the labour market and the continuation of their professional careers.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I consider it important to emphasise the need for training during parental leave in order to deal with the changed demands of employment and to consolidate key areas of knowledge, such as the spirit of enterprise and the adoption of a scientific and technological approach. Structural Funds could also be used to that end in the regions. I believe that our society must place much greater value on maternity and parenthood. Parents have an extremely responsible role in the formation of society: the children they raise will shape Europe as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="sk">At the same time, these measures would enable many more women to dedicate themselves to a more demanding career, such as an academic career, in addition to bringing up their children.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, it is somewhat dispiriting to stand here and speak on a report about inequality in the European Union in 2007. It should not be needed. It should be self-evident, not least in view of the fact that the EU has a majority of women. But the sad fact is that it is needed. It is vitally important to get men out onto the field of play, to get them to score goals. Otherwise the game is lost. Here are a few passes to men: the rate of employment for women must increase. They must have the right to full-time employment and the possibility of part-time employment. The pay gap must be closed. Are women in the EU really worth 15% less than men? Women must have a greater presence in the boardroom, in politics and in industry. Fathers must take more responsibility for the home and family and must take their share of parental leave, not least for the sake of the children.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There are many important things which Parliament has to urge the Commission and the Member States to do. Let us hope that they listen and take action!</p>

      <p sl="sk">I sincerely congratulate Mrs Kauppi on this very good report, which is the result of close cooperation with all members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The rapporteur has underlined very well the importance of implementing a policy of equality between men and women as part of the Lisbon Strategy. One of the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda is to increase the number of women working and in employment. At the same time, however, we are incapable of formally recognising the informal work carried out by women that is unpaid. We know women who work to ensure solidarity between generations, who act as volunteers and who create tolerable conditions for social relationships. However, this informal work is unpaid. We do not wish to recognise it officially because we do not see the money that circulates around it. In my view, this logic constitutes a form a discrimination against women. I believe that it might a matter of Realpolitik for our friend Mr Špidla to recognise the informal unpaid work of women. That would also resolve the many problems experienced by minorities, which we spoke about a moment ago.</p>
      <p sl="sk">To help us make progress on this issue, in Europe and around the world we have individuals and institutes that offer us mathematical and statistical models and the means of applying them in our policies. Among them is Gary Beck, the Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics, to whom reference has already been made several times.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the time has come for Member States finally to take decisive steps to eliminate outdated models of behaviour and decision-making, particularly in administration, in order to pay more attention to the issue of gender in all policies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Differences in the treatment of men and women still exist. They result, for example, in low incomes and discrimination against pregnant women and young mothers. Even though it is a promising sign, as regards employment of women, that, since 2000, 6 out of the 8 million new jobs created in the European Union have gone to women, the difference in pay between men and women in the European Union still averages 15% and, in some countries, is as high as 30%.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is unacceptable that women, just because of motherhood, which is a responsibility of both parents, should be treated worse than men in the labour market, which then affects their career, income and, later on, pension payments. The stereotypes concerning gender have to be overcome and it is for this reason that I am in favour of the proposal to create a budget line, within the framework of cohesion policy, dedicated to financing measures aimed at promoting equal opportunities and at financing research on the effects of political strategies on women’s lives.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mrs Kauppi for an excellent report.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe the time has come for the European Union to properly finance the noble goals described by the Treaty, such as combating gender discrimination or achieving equal pay for women and men.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The report we debate on presents one of the main opportunities open to gender equality by means of the European Union budget. It consists of structural and cohesion funds, a level at which one must see a facilitation of women's access to European resources. According to the data we possess, following the latest European Union enlargement, women have had comparatively less to gain from the regional and cohesion policy funds, and this should be corrected.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Nevertheless, it is not enough to analyze only the regional and cohesion policy funds, although their weight in the Union’s budget – almost 36% – forces us to fight in order for them to reach as many women as possible.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We also need to see what the latest developments in the traditional gender policy programmes of the European Union are, such as PROGRESS, Daphne or EQUAL. Although, this year, both the PROGRESS programme, on the whole, and section 5, devoted to gender equality, benefit from additional funds, in relative terms, in 2008 the budget line for equality is smaller than in the previous year.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Daphne programme for combating domestic violence has obtained excellent results so far and the European Commission has seen this and recommended a budget increase as compared to 2007. Both for these two programmes, and for the EQUAL programme, the Council operated reductions as compared to the amounts proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget. Moreover, the Council proposed a 7.5% decrease in the funds designed for the new gender institute, a completely unjustified decrease for a European institution that is just starting up.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, we continue to notice that the Council’s political will to materialize the European strategies for equality of chances, for budgetary allocation, is still lacking. This is why the Parliament, as a branch of the budgetary authority, must compensate this deficit and provide consistency to the European Union’s gender policy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent and very balanced report. A number of points have already been touched on. As a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights and of the Agriculture Committee, I shall concern myself primarily with the position of women in agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What strikes one first is the invisibility of many women working in the agricultural sector. Women hold 40% of all agricultural jobs, but many official statistics, including those of Eurostat, Commissioner, only look at either female employees or female employers. They take no account of assisting spouses, even though those women make up the largest category of labour on the many family farms of north-west Europe. Their contribution to the business is significant and they often help too to develop the activities of the farm and of the countryside. So I urge Eurostat to make this large group of women show up in the official statistics. I urge the Commission to take account of this large category of female labour in its policy-making.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Moreover, it is precisely this category of working partners who encounter practical day-to-day problems in some Member States, for example in building up pension rights, in accessing social security, if their farm ceases operation, if they get divorced, and if they need to take sick leave or maternity leave, though I am happy to say that in the Netherlands action is being taken to remedy this situation. I would draw the Commission’s attention to the project ‘Je verdiende loon ’ (‘It’s yours by right’), launched in my country with ESF aid to highlight the obstacles which these partners face. I hope the Commission will take its conclusions into account when framing future policy, so that, thanks to this essential female workforce, we can continue to have strong European agriculture and a viable countryside.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr. President, dear colleagues, since 2000, out of the 8 million new jobs, 6 million have been held by women. We might think that, truly, the time of equality of chances or even of the positive discrimination of women in the gender relations has come. Nevertheless, we cannot say this because the reality of these new jobs, of the 6 million women, contradicts us.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We cannot truly handle the risk of aging and demographic decrease that Europe and the Member States are dealing with today, if most of the employment for women has been precarious, part-time or poorly paid. The salary difference in Europe remains 15% in favour of women.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Member States, in general, and Romania is no exception, will have to continue to invest in education free from gender stereotypes, to adopt clear policies that would conciliate the family and professional lives of women and men.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to congratulate Ms Rapporteur for her extraordinary work and I truly believe that we need annual assessments of the results of actions included in the gender equality roadmap; we need a final agreement on subjects such as costs of maternity, parental leave, individualization of pension rights and the social security and taxation systems.</p>

    <intervention id="4-066" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, let me say first of all that the Commission very largely shares the concerns expressed by most of the speakers. Some of them – indeed virtually all of them – are calling for measures that the Commission is already taking.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, the Commission has the task of monitoring the transposition and application of Community law on gender equality. In essence this entails initiating and following through infringement proceedings when it becomes aware that a Member State has failed to transpose one of the directives properly, or when a citizen makes a complaint to it about the inadequate transposition or application of a directive. So, in terms of proceedings for infringements of the directive on equal treatment for women and men, 18 letters were sent out in April 2007. The Commission is currently studying the replies, and a decision on the reasoned opinion is expected in December.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me deal quickly now with a few more detailed and specific issues. With regard to the establishment of the European Institute for Gender Equality in Vilnius, the Management Board met in October and recruitment of the director is under way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Turning to the initiatives on the gender pay gap, many of the Members who spoke highlighted the differential in wages and salaries – and rightly so. Our response on this question is set out in the communication. In 2008 the Commission will undertake an analysis of current legislation to determine whether it is adequate and to identify any necessary changes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the question of women in rural areas, self-employed women working in agriculture are already covered by Directive 86/613/EEC. The Commission has just begun studying this legislation to see whether it is effective and to pinpoint what needs to be changed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That brings me finally to a more ideological question, but one to which I want to respond, concerning flexisecurity. The purpose of flexisecurity is to increase flexibility in the labour market – not to increase insecurity – while at the same time creating greater choice in the market by giving workers additional means of adapting, for example through training or steps to reconcile their private and working lives.</p>

      <p sl="hu">From the point of view of ensuring gender equality, I think it is vital to have comprehensive, systematic and objective information, including access to harmonised Community statistical data that are as broad and as up to date as possible. In this regard I also think the annual reports in which the Commission presents the situation of men and women are particularly important.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Community has done a great deal to expand the legal basis for gender equality, but whether this has brought results in practice is another matter. The annual report answers this question to some extent. I think it would be important to have systematic monitoring of practical progress with the strategic targets set out in the 2006-10 Roadmap for equality between women and men, to check that Member States are implementing the legislation in practice, and to review integration of gender mainstreaming into Community policy and the gender impact of various projects.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Since the future of the European Union will largely depend on how we manage to attract more women into work, we need to devote specific, detailed and focused attention to examining women’s participation in the labour market and ways of mobilising it, to eliminating the obstacles that prevent women from finding employment, progressing in their career, or maintaining work and family life in tandem, and to examining the situation of disadvantaged women (migrants, ethnic minorities, lone parents).</p>

      <p sl="en">I believe the time has come to take another step forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Malta we have several situations in which persons, both female and male, are paid according to different rates and systems, despite the fact that they do the same work. These different payments are being justified on the basis of bureaucratic criteria, such as the year in which these persons were employed.</p>
      <p sl="en">If such discrimination occurs between two women or two men, there is no violation of the EC Treaty in its strict interpretation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Similar situations exist and are evident in the public sector and elsewhere.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Although we might harbour doubts about various proposals included in the resolution of the European Parliament, we voted in favour of the concept whilst pointing out the need to protect copyright, defend linguistic and cultural diversity, achieve solidarity and economic and social cohesion, in order to ensure that an interesting idea does not become yet another source of discrimination and social exclusion.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Lifelong education and training are essential, as is the goal of establishing a European qualifications framework for lifelong learning, which will facilitate recognition of educational achievement and allow visible, transparent switching between different study options. I am also in favour of introducing a culture of appraisal in education and training systems, with reliable measurements.</p>

This is not the way to reduce inequity in terms of access to university education.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Even taking the arguments of the rapporteur that education influences economic growth by ‘increasing human capital and innovative capability’, and taking the view that by increasing the effectiveness of education and training, individuals and society as a whole can obtain a return on their investment of up to 8% per annum, we can see what countries stand to lose if they do not invest decisively in further education which is accessible to all sections of the population.</p>
      <p sl="pt">According to recent studies, 75 million EU citizens – in other words 32% of the workforce – receive inadequate education. In 2010 only 15% of new jobs will be open to that group of people, who come mostly from the least-favoured sectors of society. Hence the need to ensure equal access to education.</p>

      <p sl="sv">This report from the Committee on Culture and Education of the European Parliament takes up a number of matters for the EU institutions to work on which have nothing whatsoever to do with them. For example, paragraph 12 of the draft report proposes that the European Parliament adopt the position ‘that more research into pre-school education is necessary at the EU level, in particular in the field of early and targeted actions in order to identify the practices which produce the expected effects’.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The draft text of paragraph 48 reads: ‘[The European Parliament] believes that in order to better target EU action it would be necessary to develop a process, based on reports periodically submitted by Member States as well as on independent verification, to appraise the performance of education and training systems in the EU, paying particular attention to the acquisition of basic skills by pupils and to the achievement of equity objectives’.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Vocational education and training policies have a significant positive impact on economic and social outcomes, on balanced growth and social cohesion. Low efficiency and unequal access result in high hidden costs – reduced tax revenue, increased requirements for health care and support from public funds, as well as the costs associated with a higher level of antisocial behaviour.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, despite the fact that 129 countries have abolished the death penalty, the scale on which this punishment is used throughout the world is still very worrying. In 2006 alone 1 591 people were executed; at least 3 861 people are currently sentenced to death. The European Union is the world leader in the fight against the death penalty. Abolition of the death penalty is a key human rights issue in the EU’s relations with non-EU countries at international fora, such as the UN. This political commitment goes hand in hand with significant financial support for projects implemented under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. In addition, abolition of the death penalty is accepted as being a condition for membership of the European Union and the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is therefore even more regrettable that Europe will not be celebrating the World Day against the Death Penalty on 10 October, owing to opposition from the Polish government. I would like to express my regret that this standpoint taken by the Polish government, as part of its pre-election strategy, will harm Poland’s image in the international arena and throughout the whole of the European Union, as regards the promotion of its basic values. The Decision of the Council as regards the death penalty memorandum and the idea of a joint resolution, which the Union will put forward at the next session of the UN General Assembly, are thoroughly deserving of support.</p>

Clearly other horrors are being perpetrated, notably by countries who kill even without establishing guilt, but acceptance of the death penalty reflects a philosophical concept which should be eradicated from our societies. Therefore the proposal for a moratorium to end the death penalty deserves our support and the commitment of the EU Member States. In this connection, a World Day against the Death Penalty could have the effect of ‘embarrassing’ those States who resort to it and would therefore be beneficial.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I welcome the adoption of this report, which makes a number of fair and balanced points and thoroughly covers the main problems in relation to the Directive’s application. It rightly states that very few of our fellow citizens are clearly aware of their rights and it calls for information to be disseminated more effectively.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In particular, I support the idea of granting sufficient resources to the bodies tasked with promoting equality. Theirs is a key role here, and it is indeed imperative that they remain independent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report records with concern the fact that certain Member States have failed to transpose the Directive, or at least to transpose it fully.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the most sensitive issue here, namely data collection, the report is careful to stipulate that it must be carried out in a manner respectful of personal privacy, and solely for the purpose of detecting forms of discrimination from which minorities may suffer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When it comes to a principle of such fundamental importance as equality of treatment, Europe cannot be content simply to pay lip service, Europe cannot be content to enact a bare minimum of legislation, and Europe cannot be content to be a mere observer. These are the reasons why I strongly urged the House in plenary session to adopt the report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We have already had occasion to emphasise, in connection with the much-vaunted ‘European Year of Equal Opportunity for All’ that, in terms of equal opportunities, the key question which emerges is that of guaranteed exercise of rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In other words, safeguarding and applying the principle of equal opportunity – especially as regards non-discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin, which is dealt with in this report – involves ensuring that there is universal access to and full exercise of basic rights, such as healthcare, food, education, employment, workers’ and trade union rights, fair pay, culture and entertainment, sport, citizenship and civic participation, amongst many others. However, the report only touches on this question which, in our view, is crucial.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is clearly necessary for everyone to be fully aware of their rights and to be able to take action and obtain support when those rights are disregarded, especially in the light of guaranteed free and universal access to justice – a fundamental public service which underpins democracy – but the essential requirement is a thorough social transformation based on an attack against capitalism, the root cause of inequality.</p>

      <p sl="en">I support the Buitenweg report on equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. Discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin or, indeed on grounds of disability, age, gender, faith or religion, social background or sexual orientation remain all too common throughout the EU. Individual Member States and the EU as a whole must take action to eliminate discrimination in all its forms – from targeting individual incidents on the streets, to abolishing the UK’s archaic Act of Settlement.</p>

      <p sl="de">I endorse the report by Mrs Buitenweg on equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.</p>
      <p sl="de">Racism conflicts with all the European Union’s principles, and it is shocking to discover that the number of recorded racist attacks in the European Union has risen dramatically. That is why I believe we should attach far more importance to providing information about the anti-discrimination laws and means of asserting one’s rights. Furthermore, I support the rapporteur’s call for the Commission not only to look into the correct legal transposition of the Directive, but also to consider the obstacles on the ground.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Sometimes a parliamentarian finds himself between a rock and a hard place in the choices he has to make. The vote on this report was a typical example of that. On the one hand, we have a report which deals with the introduction of legislation large parts of which I find highly dubious; on the other hand, amendments from the ITS Group which in most cases did not remedy the weaknesses of the report but proposed the introduction of new, even worse, arguments. It is hardly possible to vote for ITS contributions. I therefore decided to abstain in the vote.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There is no doubt that discrimination is still a widespread problem in Europe and one which is hard to eradicate. I do not deny that there may be good grounds for discussing how it might be tackled jointly at intergovernmental level. In this particular case, however, we are dealing with legislation which is very far-reaching and based on a principle of law which is fairly alien to our concepts. Positive action is in itself a dubious method, but the recording of a person’s race – a condition for ensuring that such action can work – is unacceptable, both from a moral point of view and from that of safeguarding personal integrity. Equally there are sound reasons for reservations over the reversal of the burden of proof. I am convinced that our system of justice, which is based on the principle that a person is innocent until proved guilty, must be defended, however laudable the initial intention may have been.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I am voting in favour of the report by Mrs Buitenweg on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mrs Buitenweg has prepared an excellent report. Despite the progress in transposing anti-discrimination directives, there has still been no reduction in the number of victims of racial or ethnic discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Making it easier to pursue one’s rights through the courts and assistance with the legal process are very important issues, to which the rapporteur referred.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also believe that it is very important to make information on the rights of EU citizens widely available, as rights are of little use if people do not know about them or do not know how they can benefit from them. In order to deal with this situation at work, employers in Poland have been obliged to inform their employees about anti-discrimination legislation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must ensure that, in the context of the European Year of Equal Opportunities, both European Union institutions and Member States should make every effort to ensure that every person in Europe knows about their rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I supported the Kauppi report on equality between women and men in the EU. Europe has led the way to a position where enormous strides have been made in equality, all the way across the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">One particular area of progress has been in public protection services, in particular in the fire services. Yet in my own constituency, despite massive protests by the Fire Brigades Union and the public, these advances are under threat as the Liberal-controlled County Council is threatening to cut GBP 700 000 from the budget, ending 24-hour fire cover in the last two remaining fire stations in Camborne and Falmouth, while they pay themselves an extra GBP 1 million a year in allowances.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I draw attention to the high levels of poverty and isolation affecting women in some rural areas, stressing the need for effective measures to guarantee equal opportunities for women, which must be a central objective in all instruments of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and other relevant Community policies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It was also important to view improving the quality of life of women living in rural areas as vital, ensuring that they have easier access to education and vocational training, lifelong learning, new media infrastructures, efficient and suitable local public health services, and infrastructure and facilities for children and families, particularly local crèches, nurseries, schools, cultural centres and markets.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Likewise the insistence on equality for women in agriculture, and the invitation to EUROSTAT to include these categories in its statistics, thereby giving greater visibility to the work done by women.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Junilistan considers that equality between women and men is a fundamental democratic issue which must be prioritised in all countries throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The report contains many proposals on how equality should be achieved, some of them focusing on employment policy measures, the participation of women in political life and training plans of various kinds. However, it emerges clearly that, as usual, it is a question of increasing the financial resources of the Union and its power and of launching costly campaigns under Union auspices. The EU institutions are not the right bodies for matters of this kind. Harmonisation often results in a step backwards for those countries which have advanced furthest, since the starting basis varies greatly from one country to another.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Equality between men and women must be a goal for all the Member States to strive for, but the matter must be dealt with at national level. We have chosen to vote against this report, since the intention is to extend the powers of the EU at the expense of the sovereign states within the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Even though the Commission is working towards equality between women and men, further efforts and measures remain necessary, since we have not seen any genuine progress so far in applying the principle of equal pay for equal work.</p>
      <p sl="de">I call for gender-neutral pay and pensions and for encouraging parental leave for men and paternity leave. Moreover, the Member States must take practical measures to combat the inequality that arises between women and men as a result of a career break (e.g. because of motherhood or looking after persons in need of care).</p>

      <p sl="pl">In her report Mrs Kauppi calls on Member States to fight against inequality in the employment of women and men.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Inequality is most obvious in the area of employment. The average difference in salaries between women and men in the EU is 15%, and in some countries the difference is as high as 30%. As many as 32% of women have part-time jobs, compared with 7% of men.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Attention should be given to the situation of female immigrants and women from ethnic minorities, older women and single mothers, who are marginalised and discriminated against in many areas of life.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should fight against gender stereotyping, which is seen at work, in education and in the media. It would also be good to prepare information campaigns, so that women could themselves deal with situations that insult their dignity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Having served in 1997 as rapporteur on the situation of assisting spouses of the self-employed, in small businesses and farming, I would point out that 10 years down the line we are still awaiting proposals from the Commission for strengthening the 1986 Directive and creating a European framework to give a status to assisting spouses – those tens of millions of workers who are statistically invisible, and many of whom possess no social insurance cover for illness, disability or old age, especially in the event of divorce.</p>
